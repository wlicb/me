**Supervised by Prof. Shuyin Jiao @ NC State**

We are developing a virtual pet game as a VS Code extension to encourage students to practice coding while alleviating their stress.

We adopt the comforting nature of the pet and the interactions such as feed and play with the pet as a therapy to student's mental health problem. We adopt level up scheme to encourage students to practice programming with reward based on the amount of code written by students.
