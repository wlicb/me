We Designed and developed Policidemic, a serious game that simulates policy-making during the COVID-19 epidemic, with the aim of promoting players’ policy understanding and alleviating mental health and policy compliance issues. The game was developed with Unity / C#. Evaluation of the game demonstrated that it was able to improve citizens’ understanding of the rationale behind public health policies, and address the related mental health and compliance problems.
