## About me

I am a PhD student in computer science at North Carolina State University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing, especially in education domain. Under the supervision of Dr. Tiffany Barnes and Dr. Dongkuan Xu, my current research direction is to develop LLM-based agents to help with parent-child conversations in sensitive domains.
