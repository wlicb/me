## About me

I am Wenbo, a Master's student in computer science at University of Southern California. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction, Computing Education, and Health Informatics, including game-based learning, AI assistance for education and wellbeing, and human AI collaboration.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Human Computer Interaction and Computing Education.
